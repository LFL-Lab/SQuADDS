    "\n",
    "The most important attribute of a new database configuration is an experimentally verified device. These devices can be used to validate simulations in the SQuADDS database, and allow the SQuADDS program to continue to grow and be used for more design configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Experimentally-validated device results are stored within the `measured_device_database` column in the [HuggingFace dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SQuADDS/SQuADDS_DB/viewer/measured_device_database?row=1). You can upload an experimentally verified device before any simulations have been performed, or you can use this in conjunction with the previous tutorials to add simulations along with your device. \n",

    "## Creating a GitHub Repository for Your Device\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a device to the `measured_device_database`, you need to create a GitHub repository following a standard format. This ensures that your device's results are valid and can be integrated into the dataset and other automations within `SQuADDS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will have a GitHub repository for your device that adheres to the required structure, allowing for the verification of your experimental results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create Your GitHub Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "0. **Repository Naming Convention**:  \n",
    "   Name your repository as either `design_schema_DEVICENAME` or `design_schema_DEVICENAME_squadds`.  \n",
    "   - **Example**: `design_schema_falcon`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Repository Visibility**:  \n",
    "   Make sure the repository is **public**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **README File**:\n",
    "   - Include a **short description** of your device.\n",
    "   - Provide a **table** of the main measured results from the device. This information will also be included in the HuggingFace JSON.\n",
    "   - Optionally, add **links to any associated papers** related to your device.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ensure that the main branch of your repository is named `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Organize the Repository Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the following four folders within your repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assets**:\n",
    "   - Upload a **PDF/PNG** of the device design. This can be:\n",
    "     - A scanning electron microscope image,\n",
    "     - A Qiskit Metal model,\n",
    "     - An artistâ€™s rendition.\n",
    "     - The visual representation must clearly show the structure of your device.\n",
    "   - Save the **URL address** of the image, as you will need to include this link when uploading to HuggingFace.\n",
    "   - Upload the **GDS file** associated with your device. (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Design**:\n",
    "   - Add **IPython notebooks** or **Python files** related to the design of your device.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simulations**:\n",
    "   - Include any **code** related to the simulations of your device, either as a **Jupyter notebook** or a **Python file**. (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Finalize and Upload\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the repository is structured as outlined above, it is ready to be uploaded to HuggingFace.\n",
    "\n",

    "The process of contributing an experimentally validated design to the `measured_device_database` is similar to contributing other data. However, in this case, you will be adding a new row to the existing `measured_device_database` subset.\n",

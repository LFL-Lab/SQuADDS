    "# Tutorial 3.5 : Contributing a new database \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will go over how to create a new database configuration within the SQuADDS framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important attribute of a new database configuration is an experimentally verified device. These devices can be used to validate simulations in the SQuADDS database, and allow the SQuADDS program to continue to grow and be used for more design configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Experimentally-validated device results are stored within the experimental-device_attributes column in the HuggingFace database. You can upload an experimentally verified device before any simulations have been performed, or you can use this in conjunction with the previous tutorials to add simulations along with your device. \n",

    "\n",
    "In order to add a device to the experimental-device_attributes, you will first need to create a Github repository for your device. This repository has a standard format that you must follow in order to verify that your devices results are valid and can be used for this dataset. \n",

    "By the end of this part of the tutorial, you will have a github repository for your device that looks like this, and can be used to verify the experimental results of your device.\n",

    "First, create your repository. The repository should be named design_schema_DEVICENAME or design_schema_DEVICENAME_squadds and should be a public repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "The README file of this github should include a short description of the device. You MUST also include a table of any main measured results from the device. See Fig. 1. This information will also go into the HuggingFace JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    " Your README may also include links to any papers associated with the device. You can also add a short sentence about the SQuADDS project to the readme. For example:\n",

    "1. **Assets**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inside the assets repository, please upload a pdf of the device design. This can be in the form of a scanning electron microscope image, Qiskit Metal model, or artist’s rendition, but it must contain a visual representation of your device structure. This is so that future viewers can understand the structure of your device. \n",
    "\n",
    "    When you upload your device to the HuggingFace database, you will need to include a link to this PNG within your GitHub, so make sure that your save the url address to the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The second thing that the assets folder must contain is the GDS file associated with your device.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The design folder should contain IPython or python files associated with the design of your device. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simulations**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add any code associated with the simulations of your device. This can be in the form of a Jupyter notebook, or a python file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

# ![Alpha Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Alpha%20Version-yellow) Superconducting Qubit And Device Design and Simulation database

> :warning: **This project is an alpha release and currently under active development. Some features and documentation may be incomplete. Please update to the latest release.**

The SQuADDS (Superconducting Qubit And Device Design and Simulation) Database Project is an open-source resource aimed at advancing research in superconducting quantum device designs. It provides a robust workflow for generating and simulating superconducting quantum device designs, facilitating the accurate prediction of Hamiltonian parameters across a wide range of design geometries.

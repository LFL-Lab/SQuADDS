Contribute in Seconds: Drag & Drop Your Files!
**********************************************

The fastest way to contribute to SQuADDS is through our `Contribution Portal <https://squadds-portal.vercel.app/>`_.
Just **drag and drop your files** (designs, simulation results, measurement data, or fabrication recipes) into the portalâ€”no complicated process required! Our team will take care of all the data processing and integration into the SQuADDS database.

What You Can Contribute:
------------------------
- Device designs (design code, .gds/.dxf files)
- Validated simulation and measurement results (.aedt files, other formats)
- Fabrication recipes (text-based, workflow pictures, Fabublox link)

We appreciate all the help and support from the community. For any of the following, you can also simply use the Contribution Portal above, or follow the instructions below:

==============

There are many ways to contribute to the SQuADDS project. We really appreciate all the  help and support we get from the community. Here are some ways you can contribute:

********************************
Data Contributions
********************************

If you have device designs with a **validated (against measured data) simulation framework** and data that you would like to contribute to the SQuADDS project, please `contact us <mailto:shanto@usc.edu>`_. We will take care of the data processing and integration into the SQuADDS database.

For more information, see `Tutorial 3 <https://lfl-lab.github.io/SQuADDS/source/tutorials/Tutorial-3_Contributing_Validated_Simulation_Data_to_SQuADDS.html>`_ and `Tutorial 4 <https://lfl-lab.github.io/SQuADDS/source/tutorials/Tutorial_4_Contributing_Measured_Data_to_SQuADDS.html>`_, which provide detailed instructions on how to contribute both validated simulation data and measured data to the SQuADDS Database.

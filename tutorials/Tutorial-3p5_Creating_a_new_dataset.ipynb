    "In this section, we will go over how to create a new database configuration within the SQuADDS framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important attribute of a new database configuration is an experimentally verified device. These devices can be used to validate simulations in the SQuADDS database, and allow the SQuADDS program to continue to grow and be used for more design configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Experimentally-validated device results are stored within the experimental-device_attributes column in the HuggingFace database. You can upload an experimentally verified device before any simulations have been performed, or you can use this in conjunction with the previous tutorials to add simulations along with your device. \n",

This can be in the form of a scanning electron microscope image, Qiskit Metal model, or artist’s rendition, but it must contain a visual representation of your device structure. This is so that future viewers can understand the structure of your device. \n",

    "When you upload your device to the HuggingFace database, you will need to include a link to this PNG within your GitHub, so make sure that your save the url address to the image. \n",

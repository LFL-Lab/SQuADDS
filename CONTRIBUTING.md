## Commit Message Guidelines

Since 05/31/2024, we started to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to ensure that our commit messages are structured and informative. This helps us automatically generate release notes using [Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter).

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message should be structured as follows:

```

<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

### Examples

- **Feature Commit**

```

feat: add support for new quantum device types

```

- **Bug Fix Commit**

```

fix: resolve inconsistencies in edge case simulations

```

- **Breaking Change Commit**

```

feat: overhaul API endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: Deprecated API endpoints have been removed.

```

### Labels for Pull Requests

When opening a pull request, please use the following labels to help categorize the changes:

- `feature`: For new features
- `bug`: For bug fixes
- `breaking`: For breaking changes

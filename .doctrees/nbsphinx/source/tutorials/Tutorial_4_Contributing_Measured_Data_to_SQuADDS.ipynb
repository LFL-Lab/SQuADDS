    "To add your measured device results to the SQuADDS database, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**\n",
    "   - **Use the Template Repository:** Start by [creating your repository from this template](https://github.com/LFL-Lab/design_schema_SQuADDS). This will provide the necessary structure and files.\n",
    "   - **Naming Convention:** Rename your repository to `design_schema_DEVICENAME` or `design_schema_DEVICENAME_squadds`.\n",
    "   - **Visibility:** Set the repository to **public**.\n",
    "   - **README File:** Update the README with a brief description, key measured results, and any relevant links.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Organize Repository Contents:**\n",
    "   - **Assets Folder:**\n",
    "     - Add an image of the device (e.g., SEM image, design diagram).\n",
    "     - (Optional) Include the GDS file.\n",
    "   - **Design Folder:**\n",
    "     - Include design-related notebooks or Python scripts.\n",
    "   - **Simulations Folder (Optional):**\n",
    "     - Add any simulation code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Submit to HuggingFace:**\n",
    "   - Ensure the repository structure matches the template repository.\n",
    "   - Use either a pull request on the `measured_device_database` config or the SQuADDS API as described in the next section."

    "## Contributing via SQuADDS API\n",
    "\n",
    "To automate the contribution process, you need to generate a [GitHub token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens). This token allows secure access to your repositories and is essential for submitting your device data to the SQuADDS database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate a GitHub Token\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Go to GitHub Settings:**\n",
    "   - Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select **Settings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Navigate to Developer Settings:**\n",
    "   - Scroll down to **Developer settings** in the left sidebar and click on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a New Token:**\n",
    "   - Click on **Personal access tokens**, then select **Tokens (classic)**.\n",
    "   - Click on **Generate new token**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Set the Permissions:**\n",
    "   - Enable the following permissions:\n",
    "     - **`repo`**: Full control of repositories (required for submitting data and making changes).\n",
    "     - **`workflow`**: Access to workflow-related permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Click **Generate token** at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Copy the Token:**\n",
    "   - **Important:** Copy the generated token immediately as it will only be shown once. Store it securely on your PC, as this token will be used to authenticate your API requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We do not store or have access to your token. It is simply needed for the automation of the contribution process and remains on your PC. You have full control over it and can revoke or regenerate the token at any time via your GitHub settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your GitHub token, run the following command to add it to your runtime environment (this needs to be done only once - as the token will be stored in your `.env` file)"
